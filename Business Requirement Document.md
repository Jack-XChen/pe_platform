# Backgound
SAT equipment qualification records are currently prepared manually using Microsoft Excel.
Inspection engineers manually copy data, drag and insert images, and reformat tables repeatedly to produce similar reports on a daily basis.
Daily inspection tasks are tracked separately from reporting documents, resulting in limited visibility of progress and potential inconsistencies.
Image evidence is stored independently from report files, which increases report preparation time and introduces risk of missing documentation.

# Objective
Develop a web-based system that:
1. Provide real-time visualization of SAT report progress, including:
 >* Number of completed inspection items
 >* Total number of inspection items
 >* Estimated completion date
2. Automatically generate daily inspection task prompts based on the original SAT inspection schedule, while allowing users to:
>* Complete tasks in advance
>* Manually select and mark tasks as completed
3. Standardize inspection data entry by generating structured input prompts based on predefined SAT inspection templates.
4. Support direct image attachment from mobile devices as inspection evidence.
5. Automatically generate a complete SAT report in Excel format with all required fields and embedded image evidence.

# Business Values
Implementation of the SAT Inspection Automation System is expected to deliver the following business benefits:

1. Reduced Report Preparation Time
SAT projects typically require 3 to 5 weeks to complete, depending on equipment complexity.
By automating task planning, data entry, and report generation, the overall project duration is expected to be reduced by approximately two weeks.

2. Improved Task Planning and Resource Preparation
Early visibility of daily inspection tasks enables proactive planning of required materials and test equipment, reducing delays caused by unprepared resources.

3. Increased Efficiency in Documentation Handling
Automated data consolidation and image embedding significantly reduce manual effort spent on formatting, image insertion, and repetitive table generation.

4. Enhanced Progress Visibility
Real-time visualization of completed versus total inspection items improves transparency for engineers and project managers.

5. Improved Delivery Predictability
Better progress tracking and structured workflow reduce the risk of schedule overruns and improve on-time SAT report delivery.

# Success Criteria
The project shall be considered successful if the following conditions are met:

1. Project Duration Reduction
The average SAT project duration is reduced by approximately two weeks compared to the current manual process.

2. Automatic Daily Task Generation
Daily inspection tasks are automatically generated upon user login based on the SAT inspection schedule.

3. Report Auto-Generation Accuracy
The system generates SAT reports in Excel format with correct structure and formatting, requiring no mandatory post-generation formatting adjustments.

4. Embedded Image Integrity
100% of required inspection images are automatically embedded in the exported Excel report.

5. Manual Adjustment Capability
Users retain the ability to manually adjust or override task completion status and report data when necessary.
