# Backgound
Current equipment qualification records are managed manually using spreadsheets through Excel, dragging pictures and forming tabls to generate similar tables day after day.
Right now, the daily inspection tasks are tracked manually, leading to inefficiencies and risk of in consistency.
Image evidence is stored separately, increasing report preparetion time.

# Objective
Develop a web-based system that:
1. Provide real-time visualization of SAT report progress, including:
 >* Number of completed inspection items
 >* Total number of inspection items
 >* Estimated completion date
2. Automatically generate daily inspection task prompts based on the original SAT inspection schedule, while allowing users to:
>* Complete tasks in advance
>* Manually select and mark tasks as completed
3. Standardize inspection data entry by generating structured input prompts based on predefined SAT inspection templates.
4. Support direct image attachment from mobile devices as inspection evidence.
5. Automatically generate a complete SAT report in Excel format with all required fields and embedded image evidence.
